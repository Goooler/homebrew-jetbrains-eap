JetBrains EAP Casks for Homebrew Cask
=====================================

[![GitHub Actions][GitHub Actions badge]][GitHub Actions]

Since [homebrew-cask and homebrew-cask-versions decided to do not accept all
JetBrains EAP versions][1], instead, here we maintain a separated tap for them.

    brew tap dahlia/jetbrains-eap
    brew install intellij-idea-ce-eap
